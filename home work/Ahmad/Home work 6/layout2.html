            <h1>Testing </h1>
            <p>Testing (CBM) is the flagship program of Integrity Watch, widely used to engage communities in promoting
                transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the delivery of public services and projects.
                Integrity Watch first used CBM in 2007, mobilizing communities in Parwan Province, Afghanistan, to
                monitor a small number of infrastructure projects. The success of the program soon led to the expansion
                of CBM to other provinces,
                and then to other sectors: trial courts, education, extractives, and healthcare. Our particular model of
                CBM, which involves the training and ongoing support of community-elected volunteers, has proved highly
                sustainable and successful in
                tackling corruption and promoting integrity. It has raised public awareness about the nature and effects
                of corruption, empowered citizens to advocate, problem-solve and effect change, and encouraged
                decision-makers to adopt greater transparency in policies and legislation.</p>
